- I now have anger issues 
- Antonin responded, the emails are pasted down bellow. Here's the important parts:

### Email back and forward

> Dear Tobias, Raquel and Manuela,
> 
> Thank you very much for reporting these two issues.
> 
> - For issue (a), I corrected the user manual to remove the suggested `'DR'` resize function in the case of Fourier type holograms.
> - Regarding issue (b), I ran some experiments and found the origin of the bug. Indeed, the `rgb_align` script only worked for square apertures: it did not take into account rectangular resolutions. The numerical reconstructions in the manual were actually obtained using NRSH v6.0, which was released before the new unified interface. In this former version of the code, the `rgb_align` script was called ***after*** resizing the numerical reconstruction using a resolution of (2048 x 2048) defined in the reconstruction file (`recons_img_size`). Therefore, the `rgb_align` script was always called with an aspect ratio of 1.
>  
> Anyway, I corrected the `rgb_align` script and pushed the changes to the master branch (v12.1). The only remaining issue is related to the saturated colors obtained when using a large or full aperture. This is due to the fact that we removed the `saturate_gray` script since v8.0 because it created some unexpected rate-distortion behavior for the Mermaid hologram at medium bitrates (cf. document wg1m95003 attached to this e-mail). To correct this issue, you can set a larger value for the `perc_value` parameter in the configuration file, or set the `perc_clip` value to `0`.
> 
> You will find attached to this e-mail the numerical reconstructions obtained with the updated NRSH v12.1, with and without `saturate_gray`, and with and without percentile clipping.
> 
> I will propose to release a new version of NRSH (v13.0) as an output document in the next BO meeting tomorrow. In the meantime, please let me know if you still have issues with the code.

> Dear Raquel,

> The user guide code snippet was indeed wrong. The correct Matlab code to obtain the numerical reconstructions of Lowiczanka Doll are:
```matlab
load('opt_Warsaw_Lowiczanka_Doll.mat');

info = getSettings('cfg_file', 'config_files\wut\lowiczanka_doll_000.txt', ...
                   'dataset', 'wut_disp_on_axis', ...
                   'ap_sizes', {[2000, 3000], [2000, 6000], [0, 0]}, ...
                   'resize_fun', @(x) imresize(x, [2048 1024], 'bilinear'), ...
                   'h_pos', 1, 'v_pos', 0);

nrsh(dh, 1.06, info);
```
> As stated by Tobias, you should not use the `'DR'` resize function for Fourier type holograms. Also, as you guessed, the correct dataset type is `'wut_disp_on_axis'`. I am very sorry for the inconvenience, I have now corrected the user guide.
