- Going to test the suggestions from Tobias email, transcribed bellow:
> Dear Antonin,
> 
> Raquel reported a bug (see below) that led me to two surprising findings.
> 
> a) The NRSH manual recommends DR for Fourier type holograms. I added a check to disallow this, as it is not sensical. The intrinsic resolution of a Fourier type hologram is always it's aperture size.
> 
> b) The Doll hologram does not reconstruct properly with aperture sizes different than 2016.*[1,1]. Here again the NRSH manual claims sth. different and has reconstructions to back it up. Did you actually ran the experiments for the images in the manual?
> 
> I just experimented a bit (with NRSH V12 until V9) with an aperture size of [2016, 4032] and got an approx. correctly reconstruction only with the attached rgb_align script - **using hardcoded factors to change the shifts**. **The problem seems to be related to the shifts, which are applied after a correct per channel rescaling**. However, the **shifts seem to scale wrongly** or **the code of "subarray_yx" is buggy**. Do you have any ideas? If not, we can always also contact Tomasz as he is the original author.
