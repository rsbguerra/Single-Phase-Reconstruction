  - [ ] DeepDices2k
  - [ ] Biplane16k
  - [ ] DeepDices16k
  - [ ] Lowiczanka Doll

# Report
- **CGH_Venus**: Single phase reconstruction successful.
- All the remaining holograms need to be processed remotely.
- Was able to reconstruct DeepDices2k, which means the conversion script from bmp to mat is working properly.
- Just tested normal reconstruction of DeepDices8K4K with multiple viewpoints and the three images are identical, *the script is not reconstructing different views*
